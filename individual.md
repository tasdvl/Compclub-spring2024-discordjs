## Individual Project

Hello everyone! If you're using this document then that means you want to work on your **own** discord bot.

This document will detail important instructions for you, as well as a walkthrough over everything you need to get started.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
use this space here to think of ideas for your bot! you should think of at least TWO commands like this:

eg: "When a user uses the command /hi, the bot says 'hi' to the user"

Your ideas here:

## Existing bots

We have a few bots avaliable for you to play around with for inspiration!

Find them in the `playground` channels in the compclub student discord here: https://discord.gg/T2rchEpv

The bots are as follows:

**Vocabulary Trainer**

Each day, a new monster is spawned and users must type words that meet the criteria to defeat the monster. These valid words are considered as attacks. Rules change everyday and monsters will become stronger as more people join the server.

Use this as a reference for:
- use events
- respond to user typed messages

**Joke Candy Bot**

Allows users to steal candy from others! Can also tell dad jokes.

Use this as a reference for:
- call information from an API
- use slash commands to implement a leaderboard
- make your data remain in the bot even after you turn it off

**Grass Toucher**

Allows you to, .... touch grass 

Use this as a reference for:
- how to use buttons!

**Jumpscare**

Jumps into call with users and randomly plays the FNAF 2 jumpscare noise

Use this as a reference for:
- how to work with voice calls
- how to work with sounds

**Ghost Collector**

Lets you spawn random ghosts and collect them, and keep your own collection! (Based on the Mudae discord bot)

Use this as a reference for
- working with big databases
- working with reactions

## Ready Set Go!!

And that's it! Use the starter-code folder to write your own bot, using inspiration from the examples given. If you get stuck, ask a mentor for guidance on how to implement a feature!

Enjoy!
